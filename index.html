                <p class="">
                    Disregarding norms and accepted wisdom, President Trump 
                    went his own way in the Middle East and, in some cases, 
                    got what he wanted.

                    Again and again in the Middle East, where volatility has burnished 
                    or battered previous presidential legacies, President Trump has run 
                    roughshod over conventional thinking, advancing key policy aims or 
                    fulfilling campaign promises in ways that experts warned could set off 
                    a conflagration or blow up in his face.

                    , eliminated the leader of a 
                    network of dangerous militias. And the embassy move, rightly or wrongly, 
                    was a step previous administrations had shrunk from despite claiming to 
                    support it.

                    But the bold moves often had major drawbacks: The Iranians resumed their 
                    nuclear project, and experts believe they may have enough nuclear material 
                    to build a bomb. The killing of General Suleimani scuttled any chance of 
                    negotiating a better nuclear deal with Iran, at least for now. The chances 
                    of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict appeared ever more distant. 
                    And political gifts to Israel and Saudi Arabia received none of the 
                    concessions in return that would have been expected as part of a negotiation.

                    Mr. Trump approached the region more like a businessman than a 
                    politician, alternately squeezing adversaries and dangling economic 
                    inducements, and snagging opportunities where he found them.

                    Remarkably, this scattershot, transactional approach bore fruit that

                    led to a hands-off approach to bloody conflicts in Syria, Yemen and

                    In an interview, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior 
                    adviser on Middle East policy, said the administration sought to 
                    create a “core stability” in the Middle East, in part by promoting 
                    Israel’s acceptance by Arab states, which he argued would keep 
                    terrorism at bay, reduce the risks to American soldiers and costs to 
                    its taxpayers, and put the region “on a pathway to a more stable place.

                    very hard to move things toward them.

                    The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the setting for Mr. Trump’s biggest 
                    failure, may also be where he leaves the most enduring mark.

                    Eager to succeed where no other president had, he confronted the conflict 
                    quickly, cheering Palestinians who had dreaded being ignored — only to 
                    demoralize them by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving

                    The predicted uprising did not occur, but the Palestinians boycotted 
                    Mr. Trump. And he pushed them further away, slashing funding, expelling 
                    their diplomats from Washington and eliminating a consulate in Jerusalem

                    In a twist, though, the talk of annexation made possible a diplomatic coup.

                <p>
                    Annexation stalled amid Israeli political opposition, but it created an 
                    opening for a deal: In exchange for Israel’s “suspending” annexation, 
                    the U.A.E. would bring its under-the-radar ties with Israel into the 
                    open. The small gulf kingdom of Bahrain followed.

                <p>
                    More broadly, what had driven the U.A.E. into Israel’s arms was the

                    , particularly after Mr. Trump refused to retaliate against Iran 
                    after accusing it of attacking Saudi oil facilities last year.

                    “The Emiratis were looking around for who they could rely on,” said 
                    Martin S. Indyk, a former United States envoy to peace talks and 
                    ambassador to Israel. The region’s strongest military was the 
                    obvious answer.

                    For the Palestinians, it was perhaps the unkindest cut: Much of their 
                    strategy to pressure Israel relied on Arab solidarity to deny Israel 
                    the acceptance it craved.

                <p>
                    For the Trump administration, a dud product launch became a marketing 
                    bonanza. “We were nimble and opportunistic,” said David M. Friedman, 
                    the ambassador to Israel.

                <p>
                    Moreover, Mr. Kushner argued, the deals with the U.A.E. and Bahrain 
                    would eventually force the Palestinians to come around. “They’re only 
                    going to be tough for as long as they have the resources,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But few expect the Trump peace plan to be the basis of any future talks.

                    “If you have parameters which are only supported by Israel, and rejected 
                    by the Palestinians, the Arabs, the Europeans and so on, they’ll 
                    probably not hold for long,” said

                    Mr. Trump focused much of his attention on Iran, which he called the Middle 
                    East’s greatest generator of instability through its support for a network 
                    of militias active across the Arab world.

                <p>
                    President Obama had sought to entice Iran with the promise of sanctions 
                    relief and engagement with the West, an approach that led to an 
                    international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Trump declared that deal a failure for not addressing Iran’s missile 
                    program and aggressive behavior, and for permitting it to resume 
                    unconstrained uranium enrichment in 2030. So he replaced carrots with 
                    sticks, withdrawing from the agreement and launching a “maximum pressure” 
                    campaign aimed at constricting Iran’s finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In January, Mr. Trump took aim at Iran’s regional militia network, 
                    ordering the killing of its architect, General Suleimani.

                    The approach alienated Western allies but won Mr. Trump plaudits 
                    from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., rivals of Iran who resented

                    The pressure campaign — including sanctions on Iran’s oil sales and 
                    financial transactions — has choked its economy. Its currency plunged 
                    nearly 50 percent against the dollar in the last month. Iranian

                    Mr. Trump and his allies say the policy has reduced the Iranian threat 
                    by degrading its ability to finance militias in Iraq and Syria, the 
                    Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

                    “That’s money denied, it’s resources unavailable, it’s terror attacks

                    Iran has also dialed down provocative activity in the Persian Gulf in 
                    recent months, which administration officials cast as a direct result 
                    of American pressure. Iranian politicians, however, say it reflects a 
                    fear that conflict would only help Mr. Trump win a second term.

                    But such talks seem remote. Iranian politicians said the Suleimani 
                    killing would bar the country’s leaders from negotiating with 
                    Mr. Trump.

                    to build a bomb.

                    Regardless who wins the November election, Mr. Trump has brought about 
                    changes in the Middle East that the next administration must take

                    The momentum toward normalization agreements could continue, with Saudi 
                    Arabia, whose stance toward Israel has warmed under Crown Prince Mohammed, 
                    looming as the largest potential prize. A future United States 
                    administration could use that enticement to press Israel for concessions 
                    toward the Palestinians. But there is much concern in Israel about how the 
                    Palestinians would react to their abandonment by more of the Arab world.

                    With Iran’s government in dire financial straits, some of its regional 
                    allies have questioned how long it can hang on. The next administration 
                    could use that distress as leverage, even if in the pursuit of drastically 
                    different objectives.

                    Even some critics said Mr. Trump’s lack of interest in traditional 
                    talking points about democracy and human rights had brought a new 
                    frankness to age-old discussions about the United States’ dealings

                    record held at least one lesson for his successors: The prospect of 
                    blowback from critics and allies need not be paralyzing.

                    “They may not like what we’re doing,” he said, but Mr. Trump had shown 
                    that “if it’s in our interest to do it, we just need to forge ahead.”
